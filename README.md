##  How to run

1. **Build the project**

   ```sh
   cargo build 
   ```

2. **Start the server**

   ```sh
   cargo run --bin server
   ```

   This will bind to `127.0.0.1:2000` and wait for incoming client connections.

3. **Start three clients**
   In *three* separate terminals, run:

   ```sh
   cargo run --bin client
   ```

   Each client will connect to the server on port 2000.

4. **Chat!**

    * Type a message in *any* client and press Enter.
    * The server logs the raw message it received and then broadcasts it back to *all* connected clients.
    * Each client prints incoming messages prefixed with `From server:`.
